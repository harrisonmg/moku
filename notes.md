- state chart string const
- state enum
- per state
    * state node type
        + impl state ref
            + some for matcing
            + dispatch for descendents
            + none for rest
    * substate enum
        + none variant
        + this state
        + is state
        + for parent states
            + current state
            + is ancestor

                + need to split out substates + descendents
            + state matches
    * superstate enum
        + don't need for topstate
        + ref to each superstate
        + function from superstate superstate enum
- state machine
    * private new fn
    * trait impl
    * trivial state ref
- builder
    * mostly trivial

# macro data
- states
    * build tree from list of relations
        + descendent list per substate

# validations TODO
- state definition can't be found
- enter isn't defined and can't be autogenerated
- Superstates type is defined by the user

# features
- no dynamic memory allocation
- no_std option

# shortcomings
- states must be Sized and cannot contain generics parameters
