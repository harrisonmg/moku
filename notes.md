- enum of states
    * optionally override name
- attributes to optionally hold references to specific super states
    * compile error if state is not a real superstate
    * use Syn visitor?
    * maybe only make available during trait method calls?
- update and top_down_update
- function to print state chart
- no_std support seems feasible
